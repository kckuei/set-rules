# Set Game Project
For this project, you will write a class called SetGame that allows two people to play a console-based version of the game. 

## Rules
* Set Instructions [here](https://www.setgame.com/sites/default/files/instructions/SET%20INSTRUCTIONS%20-%20ENGLISH.pdf)
* Wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)) for a description of the game. 
* A demo application[here](http://www.setgame.com/set/puzzle). Try it out to practice/reinforce your understanding of what and what doesn't constitute a set.
